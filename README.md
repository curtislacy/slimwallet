svallet
==========

Tired of jumping from site to site to figure out the state of your cryptoassets? So are we!

The svallet is an entirely new kind of wallet. Rather than maintaining all of your data itself, the svallet knows where that data is held by others, compiles it and shows it to you in a concise, easy-to-understand format. Nothing to install if you run from svallet.info, and no blockchain to sync and parse if you install it yourself from here!

Note that this repo contains the UI code, while the core library contains the actual queries: https://github.com/curtislacy/svallet-core
